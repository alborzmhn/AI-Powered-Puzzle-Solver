## Project Contents

1. **notebook.ipynb** - The Jupyter Notebook with detailed implementations of BFS, IDS, A*, and Weighted A* algorithms.
2. **report.pdf** - A comprehensive project report discussing the algorithms, heuristics, and performance analysis.
3. **table.txt** - A summary of test results, including nodes visited, time taken, and optimal solutions found by different algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Guarantees optimal solutions but may require significant memory.
- **IDS (Iterative Deepening Search):** Combines DFS's space efficiency with BFS's completeness.
- **A* Search:** Uses heuristics to guide the search process efficiently.
- **Weighted A* Search:** A variation of A* that balances exploration and exploitation using weighted heuristics.

## Heuristics Used

1. **Heuristic 1:** Average distance between lit lamps (non-admissible).
2. **Heuristic 2:** Number of lit lamps (non-admissible).
3. **Heuristic 3:** Scaled version of Heuristic 2 for better admissibility.
4. **Heuristic 4:** Selective counting of lit lamps in specific patterns (non-admissible).

## Test Results Summary

- **Test Cases:** Results from various algorithms compared across metrics like nodes visited, time taken, and success rates.
- **Performance Highlights:**
  - **BFS & IDS:** Provide optimal solutions but are slow and memory-intensive for larger puzzles.
  - **A* Search:** Found optimal solutions faster when paired with admissible heuristics.
  - **Weighted A* Search:** Improved performance by reducing search depth and expanding fewer nodes.

Refer to **table.txt** for the full set of results.
